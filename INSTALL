Building the user script

Since version 0.0.9 of Linterna Mágica the userscript have to be
build. To do this you will need the following packets:

* GNU make 
* GNU sed 
* GNU grep
* GNU bash
* GNU Coreutils
      * ls
      * cp
      * rm
      * cat
      * tac
      * head
      * tail
      * cut
      * tr
      * sort
      * uniq
      * base64
      * basename
      * mktemp
      * test
      * echo
      * chmod

To build the userscript, inside a terminal change the directory to
the source code directory of Linterna Mágica and type:

     make

If everything went fine, at the end of the building process you should
see the following message:

  linternamagica.user.js is ready.

To remove all the generated files without the userscript,
type:

   make clean

To remove all the generated files and the userscript file, type:

   make distclean
