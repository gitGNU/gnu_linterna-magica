* Support for (i)frames/objects for Greasemonkey/Userscripts in
  Epiphany. This will be useful for remotely placed videos.

 * Greasemonkey for Epiphany needs to be patched to have some version
   of GM_xmlHTTP. Without it there is no chance for remote sites in
   Epiphany. Maybe with (i)frame /object support for userscripts can help.

* Support play.novatv.bg. It needs:

    - check if an argument to SWFObject is a variable (match for var) 
       and parse it for video_id or video link (see next)

    - remote requests (epiphany needs work) The xml with video link is
      at a remote location

* Fix metacafe.com high definition links
    - At the moment high definition videos are played, but there is no
       option to switch to other links
    - It is patched to work with flv and mp4. Rework Metacafe support.

* Try to support http://mbox4u.com (the player is in iframe)

* Facebook needs HD support.  Public videos work.
      - The URL is given by video_src=
      - There are highqual_src and lowqual_src URLs
      - some video links have some hash key (?h=something), that might
         not be needed
