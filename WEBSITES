This is a list of web sites that are known to work. Most of these were
found by random web searches for pages that provide services for
posting and sharing video clips. The list of the working web pages is
not limited to this file. There are other places where Linterna Mágica
works as well. It is impossible to know and track them all. If you
found something new and think it will be a good idea to be listed
here, please send an e-mail.

http://youtube.com 
    - with HD support
    - Parsing scripts (without Gnash/Swfdec) might bloat and block the

      should not occur, but one never knows.

    - If they use the same logic for video clips available after
      login, Linterna Mágica should work with them too. I never had
      Facebook account, and I am not planning to make one just for
      testing. For video clips available after login you depend on
      Facebook mercy.

http://www.vboxbg.net/

Web sites that use one of the following JavaScript libraries to create
flash objects, and have the video link inline in a script tag should
work out of the box: SWFObject, UFO, PokkaryPlayer.

Web sites that use object/embed elements in the HTML document without
a JavaScript library and have video links as parameter in the element
arguments and parameters should work out of the box.

Web sites that use identifiers to request video files need few changes
in the code, but the framework is ready.

Web sites that use RTMP to transfer clips DO NOT work.

Web sites that use clips and players from remote site DO NOT work.For
example youtube video placed in a blog or a news article. Since
version 0.0.9 some remote objects are detected and a link to the web
page of the video is provided.
