@c Ugly and dirty hack to show the IPA characters with
@c TeX/pdfTeX. When we are in info/makeinfo mode and @documentencoding
@c is UTF-8 the following should be visible in UTF-8 capable terminal
@c (and Emacs).
@set pronouncelm /lintˈɛrna maxˈika/

@c This will show an image instead of the text with TeX. This is
@c because texi2dvi/TeX does not render UTF-8 characters and there is
@c no way to insert them with commands.

@set pronouncelm @image{pronounce,82pt,9pt,pronounciation of linterna magica,.pdf}
